Welcome to the official documentation of Mappie. Mappie is a Kotlin compiler plugin generating object mapping code with 
minimal overhead.

Mappie can generate mappers for objects and enums. It aims to be easy to use, infer as much implicit mappings as possible, 
have a consistent API, and have the same runtime performance as if one would write the mapping code manually.
